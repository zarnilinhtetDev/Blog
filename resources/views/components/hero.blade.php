             The Internet isn’t going anywhere. In fact, it’s become a portal and primary method of research,
             connection, education, and entertainment in the world. As of 2021, there were 4.66 billion global Internet
             users — more than half the world’s population.

             Given the rapidly-increasing number of Internet users, it’s no surprise that web development is a rapidly
             expanding industry. Between now and 2030, the employment of web developers is expected to grow by 13%, much
             faster than most other technology careers.
             Websites are files stored on servers, which are computers that host (fancy term for “store files for”)
             websites. These servers are connected to a giant network called the Internet.

             Browsers are computer programs that load websites via your Internet connection, such as Google Chrome or
             Internet Explorer, while the computers used to access these websites are known as “clients”.
